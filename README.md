SPIRAL
======

This is the source tree for SPIRAL.  It builds and runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Building SPIRAL
### Prerequisites

#### C Compiler and Build Tools

SPIRAL builds on Linux/Unix with **gcc** and **make**, on Windows it builds with **Visual Studio**.

For macOS SPIRAL requires version 10.14 (Mojave) or later of macOS, with a compatible version of **Xcode** and
and **Xcode Command Line Tools**. 

#### CMake 3

Use the most recent version of CMake 3 available for your platform.  You can download CMake from [cmake.org](http://cmake.org/download/).

#### Python 3

The SPIRAL Profiler requires **Python 3**, which you can get from [python.org](http://python.org/downloads/).

### Building on Linux, macOS, and Other Unix-Like Systems

From the top directory of the SPIRAL source tree:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..				# build for GPU, *OR*
cmake -D_codegen=CPU ..			# build for CPU, *OR*
cmake -D_codegen=GPU ..			# build for GPU
make install
```

If the system you are building for has GPU support use either the default method (i.e., cmake ..) or explicity specify _codegen=GPU.  if your system does *not* have GPU support then specify _codegen=CPU so that no tests ar eperformed looking for GPU support or trying to run GPU examples in the absense of such support.

Use the **spiral** script in the top directory to start SPIRAL.  You can run it from that directory or set your path to include
it and run **spiral** from elsewhere.  The actual executable is ```gap/bin/gap```, but it must be started
with the **spiral** script in order to intialize and run correctly.

NOTE: The **spiral** script is automatically created, with deaults appropriate to your environment, during the build process, at the *install* step.

#### Debug Version on Linux/Unix

To build a debug version of SPIRAL for use with **gdb**, from the top directory:
```
mkdir buildd
cd buildd
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make install
```

This will put the executable, **gapd**, in ```gap/bin```.  Use the **spirald** script to run SPIRAL in **gdb**.

### Building on Windows

In the top directory of the SPIRAL source tree, make a directory called **build**.  From a terminal window in the **build**
directory enter one of the following commands, depending on your version of Visual Studio.  See the 
[CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html#visual-studio-generators)
if your version isn't shown here.

```
cmake ..		(for Visual Studio 2019)

cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" -A x64 ..

cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A x64 ..
```

When CMake is finished, the software can be built either using **cmake** or with Visual Studio.

#### Building with Visual Studio

Open the new **SPIRAL.sln** in the **build** directory with Visual Studio.  Select the Release or Debug configuration,
then right click on **INSTALL** in the Solution Explorer window and select **Build** from the popup menu.

Use **spiral.bat** to launch Spiral.  You can create a shortcut to 
it (right click -> Create shortcut) and move the shortcut to a convenient location, like the Desktop, 
renaming it if you desire.  Then you can edit the shortcut's properties (right click -> Properties) and 
set **Start in** to some directory other than the repository root.  The **Start in** directory is the 
default location for SPIRAL to write generated files.  You can also add the top directory of the SPIRAL source tree
to your path and run the batch script as **spiral** from a command window or script.

To debug SPIRAL on Windows, build and install the Debug version, use **spiral_debug.bat** to start SPIRAL, then in Visual Studio use
**Debug->Attach to Process...** to connect the debugger to **gapd.exe**.

There are a few pre-requisites for Visual Studio to be able to correctly run the profiler from SPIRAL.  These may be checked/configured as follows:

1. Start Visual Studio Installer
2. Select **Modify** button
3. Select **Individual Components** (the components already installed are listed under *Installation Details* to the right)
4. Ensure (or add) the following components:
 * Python language support
 * MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
 * Python 3 64-bit (3.7.X)
 * C++ CMake tools for Windows
 * Windows 10 SDK (10.0.NNNNN...)
5. If you add any components select the **Modify** button to download and install the required packages.

#### Building SPIRAL with cmake

**cmake** can be used to start the toolchain to build the solution from a **cmd** window, instead of starting the Visual Studio IDE.  After running the cmake command to configure the build system (i.e., cmake .. or other variant as discussed above), run the following:

```
cmake --build <dir> [options] [--[native-options]]
```

Typical options used with the command are:
```
<dir>                Project directory to build
--target <tgt>       Build <tgt> instead of the default target(s)
--config <cfg>       For multi-configuration tools, choose <cfg>
--clean-first        Build target "clean" first, then build
--verbose            Enable verbose output
```
For example, the following commands will build the Release version on Windows using the default VS 2019 compiler and install the binary and batch scripts:
```
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release --target install
```

## Testing SPIRAL

SPIRAL is released with a suite of self-tests.  The tests are automatically
configured and made available when **CMake** configures the installation.
Normally, all tests are configured; however, if a platform does not provide
required support for a test it will not be configured (e.g., X86/SIMD tests
are not configured for ARM processor).

### Running Tests on Linux/Unix

All tests can be run using **make test** from the `<build>` folder, as follows:
```
cd build
make test
```

The **CMake** test driver program, **ctest**, can be used to exercise control
over which tests are run.  You can run a specific named test, tests matching a
specific type, or all tests using **ctest**.  A couple of examples are shown
here (refer to the CMake/ctest documetation for a full explanation of all
options).  The ` -L ` and ` -R ` options take a regular expression argument to
identify which tests to run.  ` -L ` matches against a label associated to
each test, while ` -R ` matches against the name of the test.

```
cd build
ctest -R Simple-FFT             # Run the test matching the name "Simple-FFT"
ctest -R [.]*FFT[.]*            # Run all test(s) with "FFT" in the name
ctest -L Basic                  # Run all test(s) with label "Basic"
ctest                           # Run all tests
```

### Disabling Tests

It is possible to disable the setup of tests when configuring the installation
with **CMake**.  There are five categories of tests: Basic, Advanced, Scalar-Transforms, OpenMP, and
X86-SIMD.  Each category of test may be turned off by adding a define on the
cmake command line, as follows:
```
-DTESTS_RUN_BASIC=OFF                       # Turn off basic tests
-DTESTS_RUN_ADVANCED=OFF                    # Turn off Advanced tests
-DTESTS_RUN_SCALAR_TRANSFORMS=OFF           # Turn off FFT tests
-DTESTS_RUN_OPENMP=OFF                      # Turn off Search tests
-DTEST_RUN_X86_SIMD=OFF                     # Turn off X86-SIMD tests
```

### Running Tests on Windows

**make** is genarally not available on Windows, so we need to use **ctest** in
order to run the tests.  For Windows **ctest** needs to be informed which
confiuration was built, using the ` -C <config> ` option; where ` <config> `
is typically ` Release ` or ` Debug `. Other than this caveat, tests are configured, run, or
inhibited exactly the same on Windows as Linux/Unix.  For example:
```
cd build
ctest -C Release -R Simple-FFT     # Run the test matching the name "Simple-FFT" on Release build
ctest -C Release -R [.]*FFT[.]*    # Run all test(s) with "FFT" in the name on Release build
ctest -C Debug -L Basic            # Run all test(s) with label "Basic" on Debug build
ctest -C Release                   # Run all tests on Release build
```

### Debugging Failed Tests

Should a test fail you can view the complete test inputs/outputs generated
during the test run.  Beneath the `<build>` folder is a **Testing/Temporary**
folder where **ctest** logs all the generated information.  The data for the
last test run is contained in the file **LastTest.log**.  A record of failed
tests is available in the file **LastTestFailed.log**.

Spiral Profiler
--------------

The performance measurement functionality is in the **profiler** subdirectory.  It has the 
mechanisms for asynchronously measuring code performance.  Refer to the **README** in 
the **profiler** directory.

The interface from SPIRAL to the profiler is in **namespaces/spiral/profiler**.

Several tests rely in the **profiler** to build and measure performance in order
to arrive at a "good" solution.  A basic functionality test for the **profiler**
is run as par tof the basic tests.  If this test is not successful then later,
more advanced, tsets depening on **profiler** will be skipped.

NOTE: linux differentiates between *skipped* and *failed* tests and summarizes
those results appropriately.  However, **Windows** does not and reports *skipped*
tests as *passed*.  In order to avoid skipped tests being reported as passed,
the convention is to output a message indicating *skipping test* and then mark
it *failed*.  An inspection of the file **LastTest.log** will identify those
tests that were skipped vs failed.
