## Change Summary

### New Features

#### Spiral Packages:
Automatically search for and include in the build process anything implied (by the presence of CMakeLists.txt) for  installed spiral-packages (i.e., packages added to <spiral>/namespaces/packages/XXXX).  Any tests included with the package may then be run as part of Spiral testing.

#### CUDA:
First release to provide support for CUDA and generating GPU code. 
Added support for CUDA compiler (nvcc).
Added support and revised breakdown rules to provide CUDA support.

#### Spiral Code Generation:
Some tweaks and minor enhancements, including the ability to output the ruletree used when outputting/printing code

#### BuildInfo:
A new Spiral command: BuildInfo(), can be run at the Spiral prompt to get information about the build (e.g., version, branch, etc).  Output from this should be included with any issue(s) reported.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed couple of minor issues with PROFILER_LOCAL_ARGS (starting profiler)
* Remove "load()", in favor of using "Load()" exclusively (obsolete/redundant)
* Improved comments / removed obsolete/dead code
* Avoid AppendTo() (just Print()) to speed up writing of large generated files
* Fix target for profiler when on PPC
* Fix rows/columns mismatch in profiler for CVector
* Fix (add CVector) support in profiler on PPC

### Known Issues

None at present.

## Change Summary

### New Features

#### Memory Management:
The memory manager has been significantly overhauled.  SPIRAL will allocate
multiple memory Arenas to handle storage requirements, limited by the resources
to OS is willing to grant.  The initial amount of memory allocated for data
storage (default is 1 GByte) is used as the size for additional arenas.

#### CVector:
Added new profiler target request CVector(code, vector, opts) that applies the transform (implemented by code) to the vector and returns the result.

#### Testing:
New tests added and more rigourous checking to ensure test results are valid.
Report if a test is skipped (prior to this skipped was treated as passed).

Support building 32 bit version (with cmake) on Windows

### Bug Fixes

* Rewrote internal GAP function ProdVectorMatrix() to properly support symbolic matrix-matrix multiply
* Fixed input buffer switching problem in lexer that manifested with ReadValFromFile()
* Removed obsolete/dead code
* Eliminated many functions in favor of standard library calls that do the same thing 
* Fixed targets to include -fopenmp to enable Open MP test programs to link

### Known Issues

None at present.
