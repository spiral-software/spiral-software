## Change Summary

### New Features

#### General Cleanup
* Numerous changes were made to clean up some old code, simplifying (removing
when possible), relying on standard library functions, and providing a single
method to perform a function instead of supporting multiple methods.
* Reduced and simplified the number of environment variables that were (or could
be) set to control Spiral's operation. 
* Removed [old, deprecated, or unused] code.

#### CUDA
Several examples (also doubling as tests) added to demonstrate CUDA code generation and testing.

#### Profiler
Several enhancements to improve the performance of the profiler.
Improved handling of matrices returned by profiler, added ability to specify
upper/lower corners of a sub-matrix (test or verify a portion of a large
matrix). 
Get a list of the best timed ruletrees
In addition, cmake is now the standard build tools across all platforms when
profiling Spiral generated code. 

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed / improved several minor issues for profiler

### Known Issues

None at present.

You can download the lastest release from:

https://github.com/spiral-software/spiral-software.git

## Change Summary

### New Features

#### Spiral Packages:
Automatically search for and include in the build process any properly installed SPIRAL
package (i.e., packages added to <spiral>/namespaces/packages/XXXX).  Each package must
have its own **CMakeLists.txt** file.  Any tests included with the package may then be run
as part of Spiral testing.

#### CUDA:
First release to provide support for CUDA and generating GPU code. 
Added support for CUDA compiler (nvcc).
Added support and revised breakdown rules to provide CUDA support.

#### Spiral Code Generation:
Some tweaks and minor enhancements, including the ability to output the ruletree used when
outputting/printing code

#### BuildInfo:
A new Spiral command: BuildInfo(), can be run at the Spiral prompt to get information
about the build (e.g., version, branch, etc).  Output from this should be included with
any issue(s) reported.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed couple of minor issues with PROFILER_LOCAL_ARGS (starting profiler)
* Remove "load()", in favor of using "Load()" exclusively (obsolete/redundant)
* Improved comments / removed obsolete/dead code
* Avoid AppendTo() (just Print()) to speed up writing of large generated files
* Fix target for profiler when on PPC
* Fix rows/columns mismatch in profiler for CVector
* Fix (add CVector) support in profiler on PPC

### Known Issues

None at present.

You can download the lastest release from:

https://github.com/spiral-software/spiral-software.git

## Change Summary

### New Features

#### Memory Management:
The memory manager has been significantly overhauled.  SPIRAL will allocate
multiple memory Arenas to handle storage requirements, limited by the resources
to OS is willing to grant.  The initial amount of memory allocated for data
storage (default is 1 GByte) is used as the size for additional arenas.

#### CVector:
Added new profiler target request CVector(code, vector, opts) that applies the transform (implemented by code) to the vector and returns the result.

#### Testing:
New tests added and more rigourous checking to ensure test results are valid.
Report if a test is skipped (prior to this skipped was treated as passed).

Support building 32 bit version (with cmake) on Windows

### Bug Fixes

* Rewrote internal GAP function ProdVectorMatrix() to properly support symbolic matrix-matrix multiply
* Fixed input buffer switching problem in lexer that manifested with ReadValFromFile()
* Removed obsolete/dead code
* Eliminated many functions in favor of standard library calls that do the same thing 
* Fixed targets to include -fopenmp to enable Open MP test programs to link

### Known Issues

None at present.
