**  This file declares  the  functions  for  the  artithmetic  of  rationals.
**
**  A  rational is represented  as a pair of  two integers.  The first is the
**  numerator and the second  is  the  denominator.  This representation   is
**  always reduced, i.e., numerator and denominator  are relative prime.  The
**  denominator is always  positive and  greater than 1.    If it were 1  the
**  rational would be an integer and would be represented as  integer.  Since
**  the denominator is always positive the numerator carries the sign of  the
**  rational.
**
**  It  is very easy to  see  that for every  rational   there is one  unique
**  reduced representation.  Because of   this comparisons of  rationals  are
**  quite easy,  we just compare  numerator  and denominator.  Also numerator
**  and denominator are as small as possible,  reducing the effort to compute
**  with them.   Of course  computing  the reduced  representation comes at a
**  cost.   After every arithmetic operation we  have to compute the greatest
**  common divisor of numerator and denominator, and divide them by the gcd.
**
**  In  the following   descriptions when  we talk  about  rationals  we will
**  usually include integers.  For example the function to compute the sum of
**  two rationals also handles the case that one operand is an integer.  This
**  is done by writing an integer $i$ as rational  $i / 1$ and then computing
**  with this rational.

**
**  '<r>  / <s> mod  <n>' yields  the remainder of   the rational '<r> / <s>'
**  modulo the integer '<n>'.
**
**  The  modular  remainder of  $r  / s$  mod $n$  is defined  as  a $l$ from
**  $0..n-1$ such that $r = l s$ mod $n$.  As a special  case $1 / s$ mod $n$
**  is the modular inverse of $s$ modulo $n$.
**
**  Note  that the remainder will  not exist if $s$  is not relative prime to
**  $n$.  However note that $4 / 6$  mod $32$ does  exist (and is $22$), even
**  though $6$ is not invertable modulo $32$, because the $2$ cancels.
**
**  Another possible  definition of $r/s$ mod $n$  would be  a rational $t/s$
**  such that $0 \<= t/s \< n$ and $r/s - t/s$ is a multiple of $n$.  This is
**  rarely needed while computing modular inverses is very useful.
