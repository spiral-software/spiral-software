**  This  file  defines  the  arithmetic  for unknown  values,  unknowns  for
**  short.  Unknowns  are written as 'Unknown(<n>)'  where  <n> is an integer
**  that distuingishes different unknowns.  Every unknown stands for a fixed,
**  well defined, but unknown  scalar value,  i.e., an  unknown  integer,  an
**  unknown rational, or an unknown cyclotomic.
**
**  Being unknown is a contagious property.  That is  to say  that the result
**  of  a scalar operation involving an  unknown is   also  unknown, with the
**  exception of multiplication by 0,  which  is  0.  Every scalar  operation
**  involving an  unknown operand is  a  new  unknown, with  the exception of
**  addition of 0 or multiplication by 1, which is the old unknown.
**
**  Note that infinity is not regarded as a well defined scalar value.   Thus
**  an unknown never stands for infinity.  Therefor division by 0 still gives
**  an  error, not an unknown.  Also  division by an  unknown gives an error,
**  because the unknown could stand for 0.
