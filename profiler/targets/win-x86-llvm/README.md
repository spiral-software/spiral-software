============

This SPIRAL profiler target compiles and links the test code using the LLVM/clang tools with
the Visual Studio build system.  To use this target, make sure that the **C++ Clang Compiler for Windows** 
and the **C++ Clang-cl v142 build tools** are added to your Visual Studio installation.
